# Android Slideshow task

Your task is to develop a simple Android APP that fetches media files, images and videos, from public S3 buckets.  
The app should display media items in a slideshow with cross-fade transitions.

##### What we anticipate to see in the  app:

1. Write the app with Java / Kotlin / etc.
2. Write unit tests
3. Use design patterns that allows flexible code structure, showing anticipation for evolution and new features 
4. Cut corners, but not to the point where the structure vanishes
5. Conventional coding style
6. README file and Reasonable comments (where needed)

##### Questions:
Answer the question in an Answers.txt file
How would you check for update and fetch media and load it in the background without stopping the slideshow run?

# Good luck!
